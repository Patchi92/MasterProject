  - Good evening little soldier. You seem to have some skills and a large knapsack.
    Do you want to earn some gold for the road?
  - You seem awfully friendly considering that you are a being of dark magic.
  - Now now. No need to be flattering. All you need to do is enter the cave and claim
    your price!
  - But what am I to give you. For, of course, you do not mean to grant me all this
    for nothing.
  - I do not ask for a single penny. Only promise to bring me one of the old artifacts,
    which my old master left behind the last time she went down there.
