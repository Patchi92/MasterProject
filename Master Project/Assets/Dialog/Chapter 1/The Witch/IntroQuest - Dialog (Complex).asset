  Text:
  - Good evening, soldier; you seem to have some skills, a large knapsack, and you
    are a real soldier; so you shall have as much money as ever you like.
  - Do you see that cave?
  - All you need to do is enter and claim your price!
  - But what am I to give you, you old witch? For, of course, you do not mean to tell
    me all this for nothing.
  - I do not ask for a single penny. Only promise to bring me one of the old artifacts,
    which my old master left behind the last time she went down there.
